on prev button, onClick effect is index will be set from current to minus 1
on next button,onClick effect is index will be set from current to plus 1

!! bug alert (index will get bigger than people length and negative)

useEffect will be used to check index value. 
if index value less than 0, index will be flipped around.
if index value is more or same as people.length-1,index will be reset to 0

useEffect used to fix bug of empty when index is less than zero or more than last index (people.length-1)

useEffect used to check index and return sensible index(unsensible will be less than zero, more than people.length-1)

useEffect have dependecy on index and people (from State)

useEffect function to be executed:

check lastIndex in people

if index is less than zero, index will be reset to lastIndex
if index is more than zero, index will be set to zero
